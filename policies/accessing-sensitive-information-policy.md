# Accessing Sensitive Information Policy

## Purpose

The purpose of the Sensitive Information Policy (The Policy) is to outline the 
principles and behaviours adopted by OpenSSL when accessing Sensitive 
Information.  

OpenSSL has a responsibility to maintain security for all sensitive 
information under its control and to secure this information against 
intentional or unintentional loss of confidentiality or integrity, so as to 
avoid financial loss, reputational damage or adverse impacts on our customers, 
contractors and contributors.


## Scope

The policy applies to all OpenSSL contributors, contractors and individuals 
who use OpenSSL information resources.

The Policy establishes who can decide on what is deemed sensitive information, 
who can authorise access to it, which persons or roles have access to it, what 
they can access, under what circumstances they can access it and how the 
sensitive information can be used.

Note: The Policy doesn’t cover how they physically access the sensitive 
information.


## Principles

### Definition

**Sensitive Information** is defined as any information classified by OpenSSL 
or by law as private and confidential. Sensitive Information shall not include 
records that by law must be made available to the general public.  

The [Sensitive Information Table] (SIT) will include the types of information 
that is considered by OpenSSL to be sensitive, this list is not exhaustive and 
by default includes any information deemed sensitive under legislation whether 
it is specifically listed or not.

### Deciding what is Sensitive Information

* OpenSSL Management Committee (OMC) will decide on what constitutes 
  sensitive information on behalf of OpenSSL and maintain details of these
  in the SIT.
* The OMC or their designated representative will ensure that the SIT is 
  regularly reviewed and maintained.
* For the purposes of The Policy, information that is deemed sensitive or 
  requires restricted access under legislation is automatically considered 
  to be part of the Sensitive Information Table in accordance with all legal 
  obligations regardless of whether it appears in the SIT.
* The OMC can choose to make publicly available information normally 
  considered sensitive (excluding information deemed sensitive under 
  legislation) in order for OpenSSL to conduct business eg program code in 
  that instance the information is considered non-sensitive.


### Authorisation to access sensitive information

* The OMC will decide on who has access to sensitive information and what 
  sensitive information they can access.
* The OMC will consider requests to access sensitive information solely 
  based on whether a contractor, contributor or other individual requires 
  access in order to perform the roles, tasks and duties assigned to them by 
  OpenSSL keeping in mind that protection of sensitive information is a 
  critical business requirement however the ability to work effectively and 
  appropriately access sensitive information is also important. 
* Contractors, contributors or individuals will only be permitted to access 
  sensitive information where they have either been given specific 
  permission from the OMC or where the OMC has deemed their role to require 
  access in order to perform their required tasks and duties.
  * A list of Roles and individuals with access to sensitive information and 
    what sensitive information they can access, will be maintained and 
    regularly reviewed by the OMC or its designated representative, to ensure 
    only those who need access have access.  This list can be found in the 
    [Sensitive Information Access Table] (SIAT).
  * Where a role is listed in the SIAT, all persons performing this role are 
    considered to have been granted authorization by the OMC to access the 
    listed sensitive information, whilst they are performing this role.
  * Where an individual has several roles their authorized access will be an 
    amalgamation of all the roles they perform. Eg if you are a Developer & 
    on the OMC you would have the authorization to access everything covered 
    by both the  Developer and OMC roles.
* Where practical, access privileges will be differentiated by user and 
  user accounts which will be used in preference to root accounts.
* OpenSSL will maintain controls that limit access to sensitive information 
  which are adequate, relevant and not excessive.
* Exemptions: The OMC must authorise any exemptions regarding access to 
  sensitive information and this would only occur where there is a business 
  need to be exempted from this policy (i.e. too costly, too complex, 
  adversely impacting other business requirements). A risk assessment must 
  be conducted and reviewed by the OMC prior to any authorisation being 
  provided.


### Use of Sensitive Information

Sensitive Information can only be accessed and used for business purposes ie 
in the performance of a person’s role, allocated task or duties as assigned to 
them by OpenSSL in the course of conducting OpenSSL business activities.


### Breaches of The Policy

Where any OpenSSL contractor, contributor, or individual who uses OpenSSL 
information resources is found in violation of The Policy they may be subject 
to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of any contractual 
arrangements.
