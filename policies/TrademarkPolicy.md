# Trademark Policy

#### Last modified 2022-11-22



# Purpose

OpenSSL is committed to promoting the use of its open source software. While 
open source software is generally free to download and modify, the use of
open source software does not include the right to OpenSSL Trademarks.

The Trademark Policy (The Policy) aims to protect and ensure consistent usage 
of the OpenSSL trademarks and to clarify how the OpenSSL trademarks may be 
used.

As a part of this process, the OpenSSL trademark is a registered United States 
trademark of the OpenSSL Software Foundation. 
For registration outside the United States, we have filed a [Madrid Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_system) 
application to extend the protection in the European Union, China and Japan.


The Policy aims to:

1.  to encourage appropriate, authorised use of the OpenSSL trademarks;
2.  to clarify proper usage of OpenSSL trademarks by third parties;
3.  to prevent misuse of OpenSSL trademarks that can confuse or mislead
    users with respect to OpenSSL or its affiliates.

Please note that it is not the goal of The Policy to limit commercial
activity around OpenSSL. We encourage businesses to work on OpenSSL
while being compliant with The Policy.


# Scope

The Policy encompasses all marks, in word and logo form including but not 
limited to, OpenSSL name and derivatives thereof, software names, project 
names, logos and styles collectively referred to as "OSSL Trademarks". 

The Policy applies to all persons who use or intend to use OSSL Trademarks.


# Principles

services in a way that is accurate, not misleading or disparaging of 
OpenSSL,its products, services, communities, or users.

part of a larger mark. 
* You may not use marks that are confusingly similar to OSSL Trademarks, or 
that may be misleading or cause confusion in the marketplace or implies any 
affiliation with or endorsement by OpenSSL.
* Except as provided in The Policy, use of OSSL Trademarks, is prohibited 
without express written permission from OpenSSL.  Use without written

    OpenSSL project.

    the OpenSSL Software Foundation.

3.  Include a disclaimer of sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement by
