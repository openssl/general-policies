# Sponsorship Policy

## Purpose

The purpose of the Sponsorship Policy (The Policy) is to outline the principles
 and behaviours adopted by OpenSSL when receiving or providing sponsorship.  

The Policy will ensure that only appropriate sponsorship is received or 
provided by OpenSSL, i.e. that sponsorship aligns with OpenSSL's core beliefs, 
ethical responsibilities, community expectations and meets legal requirements.

_**Please note: OpenSSL does not currently provide sponsorship and is not 
intending to commence sponsorship in the forseeable future.**_


## Scope

The policy applies to all Organisations, individuals and entities that provide 
sponsorship to OpenSSL and to any organisation, individual or entity that 
OpenSSL sponsors.

The Policy establishes a framework by which new and renewing sponsorships are 
assessed, negotiated, formalised, leveraged, managed, and measured for both the
 sponsorship of OpenSSL and any sponsorship that OpenSSL may provide in the 
future.  


## Principles

### Definition

**Sponsorship** is the provision of support to an organisation, individual or 
entity from an external source, it can take many forms including but not 
limited to, financial assistance, preferential treatment, free products, 
resources or beneficial "in kind" arrangements.


### Levels of Sponsorship provided to OpenSSL
Details of Sponsorship options are located on OpenSSL's [Sponsorship webpage].

Sponsorship falls into the following categories

* Exceptional
* Platinum
* Gold
* Silver
* Bronze
* [GitHub Sponsors]



### Sponsorship Decisions

Only the OMC, in line with The Policy, can decide whether to accept sponsorship
 or to provide sponsorship.
Sponsorship provided via [GitHub Sponsors] in part or in whole, is deemed to be
 appropriate sponsorship by the OMC, however the OMC reserves the right to 
reject any sponsorship provided via the [GitHub Sponsors] where it is deemed by
 the OMC, to be inappropriate.


### Sponsorship assessment

#### OpenSSL Receiving Sponsorship

The OMC will assess each offer to provide sponsorship, except where provided 
via [GitHub Sponsors], under the following criteria:
* whether sponsorship supports the achievement of OpenSSL's goals, objectives 
and priorities;
* whether it does not cause a conflict of interest, or regulatory or legal 
infringement;
* whether it demonstrates ethical, impartial and fair principles;
* whether it complies with OpenSSL's Code of Conduct Policy;
* whether it is likely to cause offense or distress to OpenSSL's community;
* whether it damages OpenSSL's reputation.

Where a sponsorship is reported to the OMC as a potential inappropriate sponsor
 the above criteria will be used to assess that sponsorship regardless of where
 the sponsorship resides, i.e. [GitHub Sponsors] or direct arrangement with 
OpenSSL.


**Recording Sponsors**
* For Sponsorship of OpenSSL, at Bronze Level or above, the sponsorship must 
be recorded in the *OpenSSL management accounting* spreadsheet.
* For Sponsorship of OpenSSL, at Platinum Level or above, a Sponsorship 
Agreement, should be entered into.  It should clearly set out:
   * the rights and obligations between both parties;
   * clearly confirm any commitments made to each other;
   * Include Term of Sponsorship, any Exclusivity requirements, payment 
requirements, agreed benefits, and termination of agreement details.
* For Sponsorship of OpenSSL made via [GitHub Sponsors], <$400/mth and One-off 
payments,  the information provided via [GitHub Sponsors] registration process 
is deemed sufficient record of the sponsorship provided.
* Acknowledgement of Sponsors on OpenSSL's website, including logos, company 
details and links to external websites will only ocurr with express permission 
of the sponsoring organisation, individual or entity.  At the end of the 
sponsorship period, where sponsorship is not renewed, acknowledgements will be 
removed from the OpenSSL website.
* For sponsors on [GitHub Sponsors] that have elected to be _public_, it is 
deemed that they have provided express permission for such acknowledgement as 
provided by [GitHub Sponsors] and to receiving direct contact from OpenSSL.



#### OpenSSL Providing Sponsorship

_**OpenSSL does not currently provide sponsorship and is not intending to 
commence sponsorship in the forseeable future.**_

Below sets out how OpenSSL will assess requests to provide sponsorship.

The OMC will assess each application for sponsorship, under the following 
criteria:
* Does sponsoring support OpenSSL's goals, objectives and priorities;
* Could sponsoring be perceived as a conflict of interest, or impartial;
* Does sponsoring breach any legal or regulatory requirements;
* Does the Organisation, Individual or Entity demonstrate principles and 
values that align with OpenSSL's;
* Will sponsoring damage OpenSSL's reputation;
* Could sponsoring cause offense or distress to OpenSSL's community;
* What is the financial implication of sponsoring to OpenSSL;
* What are the benefits of sponsoring this Organisation, Individual or Entity;
* Does sponsoring further Open Source principles.

Where a sponsorship is reported to the OMC as potentially inappropriate the 
above criteria will be used to assess that sponsorship.

**Recording Sponsorship**
All sponsorship arrangements with Organisations, Individuals or Entities that 
OpenSSL sponsors must be recorded in the supplemental table _OpenSSL 
Sponsorship_ and documentation saved into the _OpenSSL/OSF/Sponsorship_ folder.
The supplemental table _OpenSSL Sponsorship_ and the _OpenSSL/OSF/Sponsorship_ 
folder will be created when the first sponsorship by OpenSSL occurs.

The supplemental table _OpenSSL Sponsorship_ will contain the following information:
* Name of Organisation, Individual or Entity being sponsored;
* Duration of sponsorship arrangement, including start and end dates;
* Value of sponsorship in $US and local currency (where applicable);
* Details of what is being supplied under the sponsorship e.g. financial aid, 
resources etc;
* Any conditions that apply to the sponsorship;
* Contact details for the Organisation, Individual or Entity;
* Reason for approving sponsorship.



### Inappropriate Sponsorship

The following entities have been deemed inappropriate sponsorship by the OMC.
OpenSSL will not accept sponsorship from, nor provide sponsorship to, any of 
the following:
* Political Parties;
* Governments;
* Known criminal organisations or individuals.
