# Sponsorship Policy

## Purpose

The purpose of the Sponsorship Policy (The Policy) is to outline the principles
 and behaviours adopted by OpenSSL when receiving or providing sponsorship.  

The Policy will ensure that only appropriate sponsorship is received or 
provided by OpenSSL, i.e. that sponsorship aligns with OpenSSL's Mission and values, 
community expectations and meets legal requirements.


## Scope

The policy applies to all Organisations, individuals and entities that provide 
sponsorship to OpenSSL and to any organisation, individual or entity that 
OpenSSL sponsors.

The Policy establishes a framework by which new and renewing sponsorships are 
assessed, formalised, managed, and measured for both the sponsorship of OpenSSL
 and any sponsorship that OpenSSL may provide.  


## Principles

### Definition

**Sponsorship** is the provision of support to an organisation, individual or 
entity from an external source, it can take many forms including but not 
limited to, financial assistance, preferential treatment, free products, 
resources or beneficial "in kind" arrangements.


### Levels of Sponsorship provided to OpenSSL
Details of Sponsorship options are located on OpenSSL's [Sponsorship webpage].


### Sponsorship Decisions

Only the OMC, in line with The Policy, can decide whether to accept sponsorship
 or to provide sponsorship.
Sponsorship provided via [GitHub Sponsors] in part or in whole, is deemed to be
 accepted sponsorship by the OMC, however the OMC reserves the right to reject 
any sponsorship provided via the [GitHub Sponsors] where it is deemed by the 
OMC, to be inappropriate.


### Sponsorship assessment

#### OpenSSL Receiving Sponsorship

The OMC will assess each offer to provide sponsorship, except where provided 
via [GitHub Sponsors], under the following criteria:
* whether it aligns with OpenSSL's Mission and values;
* whether sponsorship supports the achievement of OpenSSL's goals, objectives 
and priorities;
* whether it does not cause a conflict of interest, or regulatory or legal 
infringement;
* whether it complies with OpenSSL's Code of Conduct Policy;
* whether it is likely to cause offense or distress to OpenSSL's community;
* whether it damages OpenSSL's reputation.

Where a sponsorship is reported to the OMC as a potential inappropriate sponsor
 the above criteria will be used to assess that sponsorship regardless of where
 the sponsorship resides, i.e. [GitHub Sponsors] or direct arrangement with 
OpenSSL.


**Recording Sponsorship of OpenSSL**
* For Sponsorship made via [GitHub Sponsors], <$400/month and One-off payments,  
the information provided via [GitHub Sponsors] registration process is deemed 
sufficient record of the sponsorship provided.
* For Sponsorship at Platinum Level or above, a Sponsorship Agreement, should 
be entered into. It should clearly set out:
   * the rights and obligations between both parties;
   * clearly confirm any commitments made to each other;
   * Include Term of Sponsorship, any exclusivity requirements, payment 
requirements, agreed benefits, and termination of agreement details.
* For all Sponsorship, at Bronze Level or above, (including GitHub Sponsors 
$400/month or above) the sponsorship must be documented and recorded in an 
appropriate system so that it can be identified and managed.

   Details to be recorded in this system are:
     * Name of Organisation, Individual or Entity providing sponsorship;
     * Duration of sponsorship arrangement, including start and end dates (where applicable);
     * Value of sponsorship in $US and local currency (where applicable);
     * Details of what is being supplied under the sponsorship e.g. financial aid, 
resources etc;
     * Any conditions that apply to the sponsorship;
     * Whether permission to display logos, company details and links to their 
websites has been provided;
     * Contact details for the Organisation, Individual or Entity.

* Acknowledgement of Sponsors on OpenSSL's website, including logos, company 
details and links to external websites will only ocurr with express permission 
of the sponsoring organisation, individual or entity.  At the end of the 
sponsorship period, where sponsorship is not renewed, acknowledgements will be 
removed from the OpenSSL website.
* For sponsors on [GitHub Sponsors] that have elected to be _public_, it is 
deemed that they have provided express permission for such acknowledgement as 
provided by [GitHub Sponsors] and to receiving direct contact from OpenSSL.


#### OpenSSL Providing Sponsorship


Below sets out how OpenSSL will assess requests to provide sponsorship.

The OMC will assess each application for sponsorship, under the following 
criteria:
* Does sponsoring support OpenSSL's Mission and values, it's goals, objectives 
and priorities;
* Could sponsoring be perceived as a conflict of interest, or impartial;
* Does sponsoring breach any legal or regulatory requirements;
* Will sponsoring damage OpenSSL's reputation;
* Could sponsoring cause offense or distress to OpenSSL's community;
* What is the financial implication of sponsoring to OpenSSL;
* What are the benefits of sponsoring this Organisation, Individual or Entity;
* Does sponsoring further Open Source principles.

Where a sponsorship is reported to the OMC as potentially inappropriate the 
above criteria will be used to assess that sponsorship.
