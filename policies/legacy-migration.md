# Legacy Provider Policy

## Purpose
The Legacy Provider exists to create an opt-in availability mechanism for
algorithms that, for various reasons, should have their use discouraged.  These
reasons include, but are not limited to:

* Discovered security issues leaving the algorithm in question unsafe for
  general use

* Lack of popular use (i.e. balancing code size vs consumption frequency)

OpenSSL recognizes that consumption of these algorithms may continue to be
required by consuming applications after the conditions above have been
recognized.  The Legacy provider exists to provide a mechanism for such
applications to continue having access to these algorithms while preventing
applications that don't require them from inadvertently using them.

## Constraints on moving an algorithm to the legacy provider

1) Migration of an algorithm to the legacy provider must occur on a major
release boundary.  Once a major release includes a given algorithm in a given
provider, it must remain there for every minor release in that major stream.

2) Prior to migration, the migration must be announced for at least one 
minor release (see announcement mechanism below).

3) Coincidental to the announcement above, the algorithm in question may be made
available in both the source provider and the legacy provider.

## Promotion of algorithms in the legacy provider to the default provider

Should the need arise, legacy provider algorithms may be promoted to the default
provider at any time.  Removal from the Legacy provider should occur only on
major release boundaries.

## Migration announcement mechanism

Announcements of migrations from a source provider to the Legacy provider is
made via the DEPRECATIONS.md file in the source code root directory for
OpenSSL.  This file will list all the identities of the algorithm (names,
possible OIDs, possible NIDs), the version in  which the deprecation was
announced, and the version in which the algorithm is to be removed from the
source provider.  Note that deprecations may also be announced in the release
notes.
