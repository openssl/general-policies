# Trademark Policy

#### Last modified 2022-11-22



# Purpose

OpenSSL is committed to promoting the use of its open source software. While
open source software is generally free to download and modify, the use of
open source software does not include the right to OpenSSL Trademarks.

The Trademark Policy (The Policy) aims to protect and ensure consistent usage
of the OpenSSL trademarks and to clarify how the OpenSSL trademarks may be
used.

As a part of this process, the OpenSSL trademark is a registered United States
trademark of the OpenSSL Software Foundation.
For registration outside the United States, we have filed a [Madrid Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_system)
application to extend the protection in the European Union, China and Japan.


The Policy aims to:

1.  to encourage appropriate, authorised use of the OpenSSL trademarks;
2.  to clarify proper usage of OpenSSL trademarks by third parties;
3.  to prevent misuse of OpenSSL trademarks that can confuse or mislead
    users with respect to OpenSSL or its affiliates.

Please note that it is not the goal of The Policy to limit commercial
activity around OpenSSL. We encourage businesses to work on OpenSSL
while being compliant with The Policy.


# Scope

The Policy encompasses all marks, in word and logo form including but not
limited to, OpenSSL name and derivatives thereof, software names, project
names, logos and styles collectively referred to as "OSSL Trademarks".

part of a larger mark.

    the OpenSSL Software Foundation.

3.  Include a disclaimer of sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement by

    project website.
