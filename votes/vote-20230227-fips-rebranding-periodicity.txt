Topic: Premium support customers get one zero cost FIPS re-brand per year.
Comment: * Existing FIPS validations can be re-branded.  Pending and future
           validations cannot be re-branded until after the certificate
           is issued.
         * The old FOM for OpenSSL 1.0.2 cannot be re-branded.
         * Re-brands cannot be banked.  If one isn't used in any
           year, it is lost.
         * A re-brand that spans contract renewal counts against the
           year the process began (i.e. the earlier year).
         * Premium support customers must have premium support both at
           the time of initiating the re-brand and when it concluded.
         * The year is defined by the beginning and renewal of the contract.
           A contract starting or renewing on the 1st of May means the
           year runs 1st of May through 30th of April inclusive.
