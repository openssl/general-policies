Principles
----------

### Travel Authorisation

-   All travel arrangements must be authorized by a designated *Travel Approver*.
-   Manager's travel to be approved by the OMC.
-   Travel should be approved prior to the expected date of travel
    (ideally a minimum of 2 weeks prior), depending on the circumstances
    and the required travel arrangement time period.
-   Travellers are not allowed to authorize their own travel
    arrangements.
-   Any ad-hoc variations to The Policy must be authorised by the OMC.

Only the OMC can appoint Travel Approvers and amend the ***Travel
Approver Table***.

Travel Approver's can only authorise travel up to the limits specified
in the ***Travel Approver Table***.

  | Travel Approver Table | Total Value of Travel |
  | --- | --- |
  | Manager or the OMC | US $15,000 |
  | Travel over US $15,000 can only get approval direct from the OMC |

<br>

### Travel Arrangements

Except where OpenSSL has arranged and paid for a group booking, the Traveller is responsible for making and paying for all travel
arrangements including but not limited to; booking and payment of all
transportation, accommodation, conference fees, meals and travel-related
expenses.

### International Travel

-   International business trips should be authorized at least 2 months
    before the expected travel date, where practical.
-   Visas or other fees related to border requirements are eligible for
    reimbursement.
-   Travel Insurance is needed for all international travel and is
    reimbursable. Where the travel insurance covers a period of travel
    unrelated to business (e.g. where you add on extra days) the cost of
    the insurance should be on a pro-rata basis as only the business
    portion is reimbursable.
-   Any medical expenses not covered under the Travel Insurance, are at
    the Traveller's own cost.

### Transportation

The Traveller can claim reimbursement for any means of transportation
that is needed to fulfil their duties to OpenSSL. Including a return
plane, boat, train, coach ticket, private vehicle and/or rental car subject to the limits
and restrictions listed in The Policy.

The Traveller should travel using the most effective and economical
means, taking into account the distance and time taken to travel.

#### Taxis

While traveling, Travellers will be reimbursed when using a taxi service
to and from; their home, the airport, hotel, and business location, all
other taxi fares are at the Traveller's expense.

#### Flights

Flights should be booked as per the ***Flight Class Table*** below and
are inclusive of 1 checked piece of luggage per person.

-   If the Traveller chooses to upgrade their flight the difference
    between the cost of the approved flight class and the upgraded
    flight class is at the Traveller's own expense.
-   Additional baggage and/or overweight baggage fees are at the
    Traveller's own cost.
-   Airport parking is also reimbursable.

##### Flight Class Table
 Total Flying Time is the time from the scheduled departure of the first flight to the scheduled arrival of the last flight

 | Total Flying Time | Flight Class |
 | --- | --- |
 | Less than 6 hours | Economy|
 | Greater than 6 but less than 12 hours | Premium Economy |
 | Greater than 12 hours | Business Class |

#### Rental Cars

***Rental*** Cars can be rented when, there is either no other means
of transportation available or where it is either more costly or
impractical to use other transportation.

-   Any additional insurance or add on items e.g. any fines or excesses
    incurred whilst using a rental car will be at the cost of the Traveller.
-   Tolls &/or Parking fees will be eligible for reimbursement.
-   Excess reduction fees are reimbursable.
-   A GPS navigation is also reimbursable.

### Use of Private Vehicles
***Private Vehicles*** can be used where it is more economical or convenient.
The owner of the vehicle is responsible for ensuring the vehicle meets all regulatory 
and legal requirements along with all costs related to the vehicle, including but not
limited to maintenance, petrol, insurance, registration fees, fines etc.  
OpenSSL is not responsible for the condition of the vehicle nor the way in which 
it is used or any costs associated with the vehicle outside of the agreed milage 
benefit as listed in the **Milage Rate Table**.

Usage will be paid on a milage basis for work related travel only ie if you travel to/from a venue
for work, you can claim that milage. If during the trip you take a side trip to visit friends this 
would not be claimable and that milage would need to be deducted from the milage being claimed.

Record the odometer reading at the start and end of each section of your work related travel.
The difference between these two readings (less any non-work travel) is what can be claimed as milage.  
Milage should be recorded in the distance measure applicable to the country you are travelling in, so either miles or kilometers.

#### Milage Rate Table
_based on each country's vehicle usage rates as at 2022-10-07_

|Country|Milage Rate|Milage Limit|

Reimbursements
--------------

Except where noted below, the traveller must keep all receipts, tickets
etc related to the reimbursement and submit these with the [Expenses
Reimbursement Form]. Photos or scanned versions of the receipts or credit
card statements are acceptable. In the event a receipt is not available or
lost the Traveller must submit a signed statement detailing the item/s
purchased and the cost.

One currency should be used consistently within each Expense Reimbursement Request.
ie if claiming Euro's the entire request should be in Euro's.
Where an expense is incurred in a currency other than the main currency of the Expense 
Reimbursement request, it will need to be converted to the main currency before being 
entered into the form.

Currency Conversion:
-   Where the expense is incurred on a credit card, debit card or via a bank transfer or 
    bank payment use the amount actually charged to you by the relevant financial institution.
-   Otherwise use the the rate you were charged (if available) or the exchange rate on the day 
    the expense was incurred and note the exchange rate in the description field on the [Expenses Reimbursement Form].

The Traveller is expected to submit an [Expenses Reimbursement Form]
within 30 days from the end of the trip.

-   On the Travel Expense Reimbursement Request, the Traveller must
    include details and photos or scanned receipts for all expenses with
    an individual value greater than US $30.
-   For expenses under US $30 receipts do not have to be provided
    however details of the cost should be included on the [Expenses
    Reimbursement Form].
-   The Traveller should cross out items unrelated to their
    reimbursement claim on the receipts; ensure any entertainment
    clearly lists the attendees and relevant company details; and
    exclude any personal expenses.

The Travel Approver or their designated representative is responsible
for reviewing the Travel Expense Reimbursement Request to ensure it is
in line with The Policy and the Travel that was approved.

### Travel Time

Travel Time is the time spent travelling for OpenSSL business purposes
that is outside of normal to/from work travel.

Travel Time payments only apply to those persons paid by OpenSSL (i.e.
contractors).

This should be done via the contractor's normal monthly invoice and
should not be claimed on the **Expenses Reimbursement Form**.

Travel Time should be listed separately from the contractor's normal
working hours on their monthly invoice, so that it does not count in
their maximum working hours for the month/year.

Normal working hours and rates apply for time spent away from home where
contractor is not travelling e.g. attending a conference or work
meeting.

OpenSSL will pay Travel Time in line with the contractor's normal hourly
rate up to a maximum of 7.5 hours per 24 hour period of travel.

*Example 1*:

Contractor travels overseas and is in transit a total of 26 hours, they
would claim 7.5 hours for the first 24 hours and then an additional 2
hours in the second 24 hour period, total Travel Time claim would be 9.5
hours.

*Example 2*:

Contractor travels overseas and is in transit a total of 10 hours, they
would claim 7.5 hours for the first 24 hour period.

The contractor then attends the conference the next day and works from 9
am to 12 pm (with applicable breaks) they would bill 3 hours for this
period.

Contractor returns home and is in transit a total of 10.5 hours, they
would claim 7.5 hours for the second 24 hour period.

The Total that the contractor can charge is 15 hours Travel Time + 3
hours normal work x (*contractor's hourly rate*).

*Example 3*:

Contractor travels interstate and is in transit a total of 4 hours, they
would claim 4 hours in the first 24 hour period.

The contractor then attends the conference and works from 10 am to 3pm
(with applicable breaks) they would bill 5 hours for this period.

Contractor then returns home and is in transit a total of 4.5 hours,
they would claim another 3.5 hours Travel Time as they are still within
the original 24 hour period.

The Total that the contractor can charge is 7.5 hours Travel Time + 5
hours normal work x (*contractor's hourly rate*).
